--COMPILATION--
due to changing some files in cs488/shared, need to compile in cs488 directory first, then cd into cs488/Project and compile
in /cs488:
premake4 gmake
make
cd Project
premake4 gmake
make

--RUN--
to run program:
./Project Assets/puppet.lua

--MANUAL--
Tested on gl28
--texture mapping doesn't work properly (only shows one constant color instead of texture, UVs are probably messed up)
