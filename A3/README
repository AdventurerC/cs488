--COMPILATION--
default is ok:
premake4 gmake
make

--RUN--
to show puppet:
./A3 Assets/puppet.lua

Tested on gl14
picking is implemented and works, but picking menu left in for convenience
puppet limbs distort during movement due to bad scaling
Menu windows might be on top of each other during first run
